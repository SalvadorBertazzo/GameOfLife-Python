# Game of Life 
Conway's Game of Life is a mathematical game composed by a cellular automata and a simple sets of rules.

### Rules:
 * Any **live cell** with **fewer than two live neighbours dies**, as if by underpopulation.
 * Any **live cell** with **two or three live neighbours lives** on to the next generation.
 * Any **live cell** with **more than three live neighbours dies**, as if by overpopulation.
 * Any **dead cell** with **exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell**, as if by reproduction.
 
### What did I use:
 * Python ( Pygame | Numpy )
